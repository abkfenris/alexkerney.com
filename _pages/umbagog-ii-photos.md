Here thar be dragons, or at least a whole mess of photos. [← Back to the Trip Page][1] Click any of the photos to view it larger and you can use the keyboard to step through them. If you want to get a set of these and a whole bunch more images you can download them from <del>here</del>. If you want to get a print, you can click the Print button below an image while it's enlarged, or do a whole bunch of other things too. Often I will print panorama's on canvas, but the print service on my site doesn't offer that directly. So if you want one of those, or have any other questions give me a holler at [abk@mac.com][2] and I will see what I can do! If you want me to look for a specific picture that didn't make the site you can give me a hollar about that too. [gallery link="file" columns="4" orderby="post_date"] [← Back to the Trip Page][1]
