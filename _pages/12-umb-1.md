Ok, you can find some photos below. I'm still working on video. If you want the journal, I've scanned it in as a pdf [here][1]. [Paddling resources][2] Click any of the photos to view it larger and you can use the keyboard to step through them. [gallery link="file" columns="4" orderby="post_date"] If you want to get a set of these and a whole bunch more images you can download them from [here][3]. If you want to get a print, you can click the Print button below an image while it's enlarged, or do a whole bunch of other things too. Often I will print panorama's on canvas, but the print service on my site doesn't offer that directly. So if you want one of those, or have any other questions give me a holler at [abk@mac.com][4] and I will see what I can do! Hope you guys have a great summer.
