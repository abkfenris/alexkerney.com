Who - What - When - Where - Why
-------------------------------

The five Ws that should answer most any question that may be posed. Or not, I guess it depends on the type of questions that you like to ask.

So __who__. Well I'm Alex Kerney, but you hopefully got that by now from the url of the site. I'm a recent geology graduate from Colorado College who has somewhat gone back home to the coast of Maine, but I still have some exploration to do. I guess that actually answers one part of __where__ too.



Skipping ahead to the other part of __where__ is the fact that as I write this I'm airborne in a Boeing 757-400B but that is less important compared to the destination. I'm headed to Colorado as part of a trip up to Wyoming to remove the seismic stations that my college advisor has scattered throughout the Bighorn Mountains.



__When__ is another question that can be answered two ways. The first way is the fact that it is later in 2010 the other is that I am 22 as of the drafting of this page. On that note I should probably find some sort of amazing picture of myself to place here. I guess that picture will work for now.



__What__, well this is a website that is supposed to be a combination of geeky place space, a place to put up photos, and to let people know what kind of travels I've currently got myself wrapped up in.



__Why__ is a similar answer to the what because I would like to be able to keep my friends and family up to date with my travels, especially as I'm going to be exploring way, way South this summer.



Oh, I haven't mention anything about a Southern expedition yet? Well that's to come. Stay tuned to the blog for updates or subscribe by RSS or email (via the form below).
