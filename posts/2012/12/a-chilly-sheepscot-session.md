Ryan enjoying the middle wave. We had a couple minute party wave with all of us out there at once which doesn't happen often in December or on 13 foot tides.<a href="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/20121215PC150011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1711 [ftmt_id] nofotomoto" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/20121215PC150011-840x840.jpg"></a>
