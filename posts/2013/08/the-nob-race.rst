A couple weekends ago it was the Penobscot Race, which was just after I
started my new job at Bridgton Academy, but being the race I had to make
the trip up there. It also was a week after having left the Nob during
my last Chewonki trip.

.. TEASER_END

Made it up to Big Eddy Friday night and ended up
horizontal pretty quickly that evening. Saturday morning I awoke and
found a whole menagerie of boaters down at Abol Bridge. We had the West
Branch posse, Maine Flows floaters, the Chewonki collective, Bowdoin's
best, some Maine/UVM crossbreeds and those in their orbit, the
infestations of the Deerfield Dryway, and a whole bunch from New
Hampshire that looked a little lost. I believe that last group might
have been from Dartmouth....anyways there were a ton of people there
from all over ready to have some fun on the West Branch of the
Penobscot.

The first part of the competition was a boater cross
through Big Amberjackwockamus Falls.

That afternoon brought
Downriver Freestyle at Nesowadnehunk Falls. I only got pictures of some
of the strangeness.\

Saturday evening brought about several Gorge Crib laps
in preparation for the next day.  I think people were tuckered out
enough to sleep well the next morning once they settled down.

Sunday
morning brought forth some anticipation in the racers, as there was very
little way of judging your pace, until you either overtook someone, or
were overtaken. Thus pacing yourself so that there was enough left in
the tank to finish it off at Cribworks means you gotta know yourself and
the river pretty well.

In the end there was very little carnage,
nothing that I saw or had to yank anyone out of at any of the three
events, and in the end it doesn't really matter who won (thought the
winners of the overall series got some sweet paddles) but that everyone
made it up to the Nob and had some fun.
