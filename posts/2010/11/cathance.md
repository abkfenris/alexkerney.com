<html><body><p>Tom took me out for my first run on the Cathance River in Brunswick on the 18th at what some might describe as an extra-medium level. Not medium, not high, but not pushing into the medium-high territory. Perfect with a little extra flow.



The lady from <a href="http://creamaine.org/">Cathance River Education Alliance</a> came along and took our picture for us.

While he may not be exactly where he wants to be, Tom still makes it look stylish.
