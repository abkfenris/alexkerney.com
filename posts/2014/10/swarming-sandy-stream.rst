After having Fall dry enough that a couple weekends ago we were worried
about having enough water for a release on the Dead River some moisture
finally arrived. [STRIKEOUT:A front rolled through, stretching from
Canada to the Gulf of Mexico while Hurricane Gonzalo passed
offshore]\ “A cold front stretching from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico
carrying warm, moist gulf air with additional input from Hurricane
Gonzalo”(clarification by Mike) brought 2-3 inches of rain to the White
Mountains and Maine. While the water started to run out of the Whites
and Mahoosucs on Friday, it held until Saturday in the Bigelows where we
got to enjoy it.

On Friday afternoon
before heading out for a lap on the NH Swift River after work, I checked
the Carrabassett gage and found it spiking over 5000 cfs. With that much
water not only might Sandy be in, but other creeks in the region might
be up Saturday too. Having obsessively been hounding people once this
rain was solidly forecast, trying to figure out who wasn't going to
Moosefest in NY, but was still available to paddle, I had an idea of who
to start getting ahold of. I went to bed thinking we had 6 or 7 people
ready to go.

As we rallied in North New Portland, and consolidating into
vehicles that are slightly happier off road, we found that we needed to
use all of our fingers to count the number in our group, but as most of
the group was pretty solid, and as Sandy Stream is more 'Class Fun' than
'Class Scary' we went with the flow. At this point the Carrabassett had
dropped down around 2500 cfs.

At the first drop with our group size it
would have been iffy trying to take everyone down the very tight windy
channel on the left side of the island, without dealing with the tree in
it, we all scrapped down the right side. A couple smaller rapids with
what I like to call telephone eddies (tell the next person the move, as
there is no eddy where you can see the rapid that is also large enough
to fit the whole group) we arrived at Auto Boof. A couple of creative
lines, some really good ones, and one drag of a creative line paddler
out of the left side hole by their paddle and we were through.

Next up
was Slip and Slide. I hopped out to set safety and take photos, and very
quickly Anthony came through and set safety on the left shore, where he
ended up getting some business. Normally on Slip and Slide you can get
yourself on line, and then be completely passive and come through just
fine, but today people reconnected with the bottom. Like Auto Boof the
landing is very shallow, but normally it is well enough padded to kick
you away without having discovered the rock. Here the prior occupant of
the red boat had run successfully, then flipped in the eddy after Mike
had already been signaled to go.

Sometimes you set up safety and then (thankfully) not get any business. There
was only one real customer at Slip and Slide.

Walker had gotten out on Sandy the day before, and not only was
it the highest he had ever run it, it was higher than anyone in his
group had ever gotten on it too (and there were some high water
aficionados in that group). They found some new wood scattered about the
run. This log found itself jammed up at the boof of California Dreaming.
This exact spot seems to collect wood very well. After some raw heaving
of it up the ledge they were able to Z-drag it over to the far shore.

And then Jeff got to bust out his 'Erhmygod' face.

Sometimes a safety customer appears before you get a chance to formally open
for business, but the customer comes first. We were all eddying out above Cat
and Mouse, where you need to make a move either in the first drop (Cat) or at
least before the second drop (Mouse) to avoid a sieve on river right. We had
someone fail to catch and eddy and swim above Cat. Apparently I was saying
'shit, shit, shit' as I went flying past everyone who had already popped
their skirts to scout, chasing after the swimmer. Thankfully it appears when
you swim above Cat, Cat kicks you left, setting you in the right spot for Mouse.

I came up behind the swimmer pretty fast and then was able to get him
oriented and out of the water after Mouse (but before the Cheese, a nice
boof, unless you are trying to wrangle a boat like a previous run). I
managed to reattain and set myself below the boulder sieve for everyone
else's runs, while Walker parked himself right on top of it.

A few rapids and quick water later we found
ourselves at the top of the Crusher sequence. The Crusher itself is a
large slide, but the bits up above it are manky in their own right.
There's a very cool looking boof on the right into a small mini gorge
channel that lets you take out and portage before the main event, but it
also had a log in it to remove. We portaged on the road and put in just
below. Crusher produces quite the quantity of foam.

A very nice creek to get back on after the first solid rain in two months.

Booftember may not have arrived, but Booftober has begun!
