<html><body><p>Baldpate Slide takes a lot more effort to get to, at least in relation to the reward compared to some of my other recent runs around Grafton Notch, so I'm happy to share some more details.



Ben and I approached Little Baldpate Mountain from East B Hill Road, and came up the trail along Frye Brook and The Cataracts. The trail was nice up untill the saddle between Baldpate and Surplus mountain, then we started seeing evidence of the ice storm earlier in the season.



A lot of evidence.



Enough evidence it probably took us as least as much time to cover the last 1000 vertical feet and 3/4 of a mile, as it took for us to do the previous 1700 vertical feet and 3 miles.



Probably not the best way up then.



The trail crews are gonna have a lot to do this summer.



It was ugly and I tried not to take any photos of that part, so here's some very short switchbacks up a very narrow trail for you.

A little patch of not heinous before diving back in.

We did spend much of that time during the heinous part of the ascent hoping that there was something to descend other than the trail we just came up. As we came over the top of Little Baldpate we saw it. Not the best looking up top, but stable and not all ice was all we needed.

Line choice was important.

It probably only took us 10 min to descend what took a lot of time to ascend, but that's the nature of backcountry skiing.



We did find some old tracks in the bottom part of the slide, and it looks like that group may have skinned right up it, which is probably a way better route if it's stable than trying to take the AT from the saddle. We threw our skins back on to make it all of 100 feet back up into the saddle, and then were able to keep them off all the way to the road, though it took some poling, side-stepping, and awkward maneuvers over streams to make that happen, so it's not exactly a snowboard friendly route out.
