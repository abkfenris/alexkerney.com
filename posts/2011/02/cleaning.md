<html><body><p>We are currently in somewhat of a cleaning mode trying to wash and making sure that everything we are bringing is relatively clean. This is rather than being relatively grimy after Ocean Tramp's last couple of trips.



Also our internet connection is relatively flakey, but we don't have our Iridium phone setup yet.Â  So updates might be flakey, but I should be getting out in the fjords this week!</p></body></html>
