<html><body><p>I've entered a video contest put on by <a title="Austin Kayak" href="http://www.austinkayak.com/">Austin Kayak</a> to win a kayak of choice from <a title="Liquidlogic Kayaks" href="http://www.liquidlogickayaks.com/">Liquidlogic Kayaks</a>. Due to the fact that I'm likely to hurt myself in my playboat with some of the stuff that I'm currently paddling, and don't have the best track record of staying upright in borrowed boats I entered so hopefully I can win a creek boat like a <a title="Liquidlogic Stomper" href="http://www.liquidlogickayaks.com/stomper_90.cfm">Stomper</a>.



Anyways check the video out <a title="Austin Kayak Video Voting" href="http://yakr.us/5ecx">here</a>Â and vote for mine. It's called <em>Problematic Love</em>. You do have to 'like' Austin Kayak on Facebook to vote, and they do allow 3 votes (for different videos) per day until the 21st, so go back and vote each day.



I will throw the video up in its original high-definition glory after the contest is over.



It's election day anyways, and I guarantee that I spent less on this than any party has spent on the ballot questions!</p></body></html>
