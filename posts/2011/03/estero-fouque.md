Estero Fouque is a couple mile long fjord, and due to arriving early in the morning I wasn't sure which way we had entered the fjord from as I rolled out of my bunk to help anchor in a little cove.

With our visiting Swedes off with Charlie investigating different coves to core Christine and I went for a hike in the mountains above Ocean Tramp.

I quickly sited some interesting looking waterfalls and started heading there direction.

The waterfalls turned out to be feeding a nice little lake.

Above the lake I found a nice little waterfall where I took a little shower.

We found a lookout over a lake....

... which has a relatively nice looking river flowing out of it.

We started to try to make our way down a different to try to get a look at the river

With some snacks along the way.

Eventually I made it down to the river which looks relatively nice, but it's too low volume to make for any sort of reasonable paddling. There may be a couple of fun drops, but in general with 150-200 cfs looking to be high-ish for the river the whole thing probably will be more work than paddling.
