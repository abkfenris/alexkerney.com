<html><body><p>I'm in the midst of doing a mild revamp to my site, so some things might be a little out of whack, but hopefully in the end everything will be working a lot better.



So far I've:

</p><ul>

	<li>Upgraded from AutoFocus+ to AutoFocus+ Pro which gives me more formatting options.</li>

	<li>Removed My PHP Dropbox Gallery from the menus for the site, but it's still around.</li>

	<li>Made some updates to the <a title="Photography" href="http://alexkerney.com/photography/">Photography page</a> and added a few portfolios.

<ul>

	<li><a title="Maine" href="http://alexkerney.com/photography/maine/">Maine</a></li>

	<li><a title="Kayak" href="http://alexkerney.com/photography/kayak/">Kayak</a></li>

	<li><a title="Patagonia" href="http://alexkerney.com/photography/patagonia">Patagonia</a></li>

</ul>

</li>

	<li>Started using the normal menu system, rather than using the Page Links To plugin and depending on having the menu get correctly generated.</li>

	<li>Added a blog category so small posts like this one don't need a picture and can be kept off of the front page</li>

</ul>

What still needs to happen:

<ul>

	<li>Build a couple more portfolios

<ul>

	<li>Skiing</li>

	<li>Rocky Mountains</li>

	<li>Travel</li>

</ul>

</li>

	<li>Go through old posts and update images to use AutoFocus+ Pro's largeimage shortcode which in addition to including a description in the overlay, it also combines them into a FancyBox style of gallery.

<ul>

	<li>Update photos on Flickr to be hosted here.</li>

	<li>Add larger versions of some photos hosted here.</li>

</ul>

</li>

	<li>See if I can figure out what is causing the weirdness in the image captions on the largeimages. I believe it's something to do with the font's ligature settings, but I have no idea where to really start tinkering with that.</li>

</ul>

I'm doing all these updates quickly for a reason, rather than getting around to them at some point as I felt like it. Saturday I hung a panorama at the <a title="Boothbay Region Art Foundation - A community of emerging artists" href="http://www.boothbayartists.org/">Boothbay Region Art Foundation</a> right here in town. It's from two summers ago on Spectacle Island on the Sheepscot River.

It's printed 1' by 6' on canvas over a wooden frame. I've priced it at 450. I also can print many of my other shots if there is interest.
