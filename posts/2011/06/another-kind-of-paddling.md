<html><body><p>For the next three weeks I will be out of touch again. I'll be headed out and along the coast of Maine by sea kayak. We will be starting at the <a title="The Chewonki Foundation" href="http://www.chewonki.org/">Chewonki</a> waterfront, and after about three weeks we will arrive at the western edge of Mount Desert Island and Acadia National Park.



The participants arrive tomorrow, and we will be headed off to our first island on Thursday. Hopefully my camera will get repaired and it will make it's way out to me on a resupply, but I will be attempting as much shooting as I can get out of the GoPro until then.



We have a couple of notable islands on our hit list:

</p><ul>

	<li>We will be doing a service project on Hurricane Island which is made notable by Outward Bound and is now run by the <a title="Hurricane Island Foundation" href="http://www.hurricaneisland.net/">Hurricane Island Foundation</a>.</li>

	<li>Watching fireworks from Harbor Island in Muscongus Bay.</li>

	<li>Swimming on Green Island and possibly picking raspberries on a different Harbor Island in Merchants Row.</li>

	<li>Visiting the Seal Trap on Isle au Haut.</li>

</ul>

Plus the usual amount of fun of just being on the water with kids.

Also while I'm out I have another picture hung at the Boothbay Region Art Foundation, and a couple more getting printed and then my grandfather has agreed to stretch them.

It's <a title="GeoGarage Marine" href="http://marine.geogarage.com/">Marine.GeoGarage.com</a> which allows you to plot a course on NOAA and other charts for free and layer them over Google Maps as you wish. It's not the greatest yet at sharing what you produce, but you can export your route as a GPX file.</address></body></html>
