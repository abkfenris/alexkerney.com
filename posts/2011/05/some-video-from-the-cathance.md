...like day 1 back in Maine Daniel, Rigg and I decided to run the Cathance. I've only been thinking of running Magic Carpet Ride for several months, but I decided against it seeing the condition that it's in and the fact I was in a playboat.



Rigg and I both had GoPros running for part of the river, and I shot Daniel and Rigg running Magic Carpet Ride with my D90. This is only from the D90 as I haven't even gotten to look at the GoPro footage yet.</p></body></html>
