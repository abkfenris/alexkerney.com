### [Maine](/photography/maine.html) • [Kayak](/photography/kayak.html) • [Patagonia](/photography/patagonia.html) • [Ski](/photography/ski.html)


As a geek, and someone who loves to be outdoors I've gotten into photography due to it being at the intersection of those two interests. I will take other kinds of photos, but photography is primarily a way for me to share my experiences with the world.


My current tools:

* Nikon D90
* Nikkor 18-200mm f3.5-5.6 VR Lens
* Nikkor 50mm f1.8 Lens
* SB600 Remote or onboard flash
* GoPro HD Helmet Cam
* Ultrapod II
* Random Tripod that I found
* Nikos N10 Timer Remote
* Sandisk Extreme 3 - 4 GB cards
* Watershed Occoe Dry Bag with Liner
* Black Diamond Spot Headlamp and theatrical lighting gels.
