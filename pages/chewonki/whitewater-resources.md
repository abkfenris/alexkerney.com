Videos &amp; Other (Not instructional, more just things that make me happy):

<ul>

	<li><a title="Wildwater by Forge Motion Pictures" href="http://forgemotionpictures.com/films/wildwater/">Wildwater</a> by Forge Motion Pictures - yes it costs money, but it is very pretty, plus you can listen to Doug Ammon's philosophy in his own words!</li>

This time they are bringing along a couple of other buddies and making quite the map along the way.</li>

	<li><a title="Seasons - Banks Mag" href="http://www.thebanksmag.com/video/index.html">Seasons</a> (once again by Forge Motion Pictures, those guys must be paddlers or something) on Banks Mag</li>

	<li><a title="The Range Life" href="http://www.therangelife.com">The Range Life</a> which could also be titled the Art of Expeditions though they don't post as often as one of the main members of the crew Brian is constantly getting yanked around the world by Red Bull and National Geographic to shoot video as part of his company (which formed from The Range Life) <a title="Reel Water Productions" href="http://www.reelwaterproductions.com">Reel Water Productions</a>.

<ul>

	<li>Also shot <a title="The Season" href="http://www.theseasontv.com">The Season</a></li>

</ul>

</li>

	<li><a title="Kayak on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Kayak-Frontier-Intermediate-Whitewater-Technique/dp/0897325893/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">Kayak</a> by William Nealy - the sudo instructional cartoonish book.

	<li><a title="Sweetgrass Productions" href="http://sweetgrass-productions.com/">Sweetgrass Productions</a> - some other college buddies making ski movies.</li>

	<li>Since I've made it to ski movies lets just keep on rolling to <a title="Sherpas Cinema" href="http://www.sherpascinema.com/">All.I.Can.</a> by Sherpas Cinema. Footage (and skiing) that can be best described as tasty. They also make one hell of an avalanche awareness movie.</li>

	<li>The grandpappy of great ski cinematographers might just be Bill Heath who I believe inspired just about every other video on this list. <a title="Sinners" href="http://www.bhandf.com/bhandf%202010/sinners%20dvd%20sale.html">Sinners</a> is amazing and <a title="9 Winders Old" href="http://ninewintersold.com/">9 Winters Old</a> ain't bad either.

<ul>

	<li>Bill filmed for Warren Miller before Warren Miller Entertainment went off the rails.</li>

	<li>And a special message to the parents: If ski bums had a Nielson Ratings Box you would find that more of them were inspired to become ski bums after watching Sinners than any other ski movie has managed. Or in other words '4 out of 5 ski bums recommend Sinners as their drop out trigger of choice.'</li>
