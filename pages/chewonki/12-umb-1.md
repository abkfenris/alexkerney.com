<html><body><p>Ok, you can find some photos below. I'm still working on video.



If you want the journal, I've scanned it in as a pdf <a title="Journal PDF" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6222631/UMB1Journal.pdf">here</a>.



<a title="Whitewater Resources" href="http://alexkerney.com/chewonki/whitewater-resources/">Paddling resources</a>



Click any of the photos to view it larger and you can use the keyboard to step through them.



[gallery link="file" columns="4" orderby="post_date"]



If you want to get a set of these and a whole bunch more images you can download them from <a title="Image ZIP" href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6222631/UMB1.zip">here</a>. If you want to get a print, you can click the Print button below an image while it's enlarged, or do a whole bunch of other things too. Often I will print panorama's on canvas, but the print service on my site doesn't offer that directly. So if you want one of those, or have any other questions give me a holler at <a href="mailto://abk@mac.com">abk@mac.com</a> and I will see what I can do!



Hope you guys have a great summer.</p></body></html>
