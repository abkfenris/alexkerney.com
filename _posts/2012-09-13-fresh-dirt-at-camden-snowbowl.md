I headed up to Camden Snowbowl two days last week, the first day was for some trail building, and the second day was for my first taste of lift served riding during their harvest hootenanny. Without the lifts turning you first need to get yourself up there. The view is always good even when it's a little gray. [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1650 [ftmt_id] nofotomoto" title="Looking out over Penobscot Bay" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/20120904P9040030-840x630.jpg" alt="" />][1] Dropping into the top section of the new trail. I believe the name is Natty Tread. Anyways it's just too the right as you exit the lift. If your headed up under your own power, head up Pitch Pole/Whales Tale (starts with Jibe under the T-Bar line), and after lots of switch backs you'll see the top section coming down from the lift too the left, and then heading into the woods across the ski trails to the right. [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1649 [ftmt_id] nofotomoto" title="Looking down the top section of Natty Tread" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/20120904P9040029-840x1120.jpg" alt="" />][2] This chute is a lot steeper than it looks, but completely ridable. It definitely ain't bad to take the first lap pretty slow. Some of the rollers and the bottom of the trail is very much still under construction. [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1651 [ftmt_id] nofotomoto" title="Looking Down the First Chute of Natty Tread" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/20120904P9040032-840x1120.jpg" alt="" />][3] Looking up another chute that was ridable by the Harvest Hoot. Notice the tools nearby... [<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1652 [ftmt_id] nofotomoto" title="Looking up the Lower Chute of Natty Tread" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/20120908P9080039-840x1120.jpg" alt="" />][4] Hopefully I can get up there some time with some other riders, my big camera, and some good light, so I can capture what has already become my favorite new trail.
