The panorama that I put up in the Boothbay Region Art Foundation gallery sold today!!! Unfortunately I don't think I can get another one printed and hung before I head out sea kayaking for 3 weeks, but I probably will get them ordered and be ready to hang one as soon as I get back! Now I just need to decide what pics I'm going to use!
