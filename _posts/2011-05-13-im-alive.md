And I'm headed North! I'm currently sitting in a hostel in Punta Arenas trying to figure out why none of the posts that I sent from the boat over the last 2 months have worked, and dealing with a slow connection. Not as slow as coming back to Puerto Williams and finding that the internet connection had its power yanked (not just Charlie's internet, but the tower providing internet to most of the town) so full updates will have to wait until I'm back in the States which will be Sunday.
