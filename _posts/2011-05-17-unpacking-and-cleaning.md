I've made it to Mass, though without the good fortune of my sister being able to pick me up I would have other wise been stuck in New York for a couple of days now due to weather. Now I'm into the process of unpacking, cleaning and repacking my gear and realizing just how much of the gear that I brought down. For example that pile of socks above? I wore every one of those pairs in a 2 month period except one pair which Christine was borrowing.
