Since I'm apparently on the holiday schedule of posting, I'm throwing a new post up. I've started to build my own theme from the ground up and relearning a lot of php/html/css along the way, and learning a whole bunch of new stuff. I didn't apply the theme here as it still is very much under construction, but if you want to take a peak look here: [beta.AlexKerney][1]. I'm actually going to write this months post over there, to make you go and look (aren't I cruel).
