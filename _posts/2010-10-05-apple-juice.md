A little bit of starter content in a nice container that hopefully won't spill and get all over the place while I'm trying to get it all set. http://vimeo.com/14702889 A miniature tripod, a cheap timer, and a slr can make for a quick timelapse. The video starts off to Rampant's Revenge by Albannach followed by The Night Pat Murphy Died by Great Big Sea set to 4254 photos taken on a Nikon d90 at Sheepscot Reversing Falls in Lincoln county, Maine.
