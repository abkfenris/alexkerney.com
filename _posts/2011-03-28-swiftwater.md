###### Another post from the past while I'm out and wandering. Sometime around the end of April 2009 the Colorado College Kayak Club had a swiftwater course with Downstream Edge. It was nicely timed just before my River Incision trip. One of the nice things about setting up our own course is that we were able to have it on or 'local' run of Waterton Canyon of the South Platte. 

<a rel="attachment wp-att-435" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0212/"><img class="size-large wp-image-435 alignnone" title="Wandering down Waterton" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0212-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> Tommy Hilleke was one of our instructors. Both instructors were awesome (Sorry, I just can't remember the other guys name!) <a rel="attachment wp-att-436" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0215/"><img class="size-large wp-image-436 alignnone" title="Instructions from Tommy" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0215-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> We started off with a bunch of throw bag practice. <a rel="attachment wp-att-437" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0233/"><img class="size-large wp-image-437 alignnone" title="Some Rope practice" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0233-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> Then we did some rope practice in the river hauling in the instructors. Jake (the close thrower in the last picture) took over my camera at this point because he wasn't going to be scrambling about. <a rel="attachment wp-att-438" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0270/"><img class="size-large wp-image-438 alignnone" title="Hauling in one of the instructors" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0270-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> A couple other paddlers came through and played in the hole next to where we were practicing. <a rel="attachment wp-att-439" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0292/"><img class="size-large wp-image-439 alignnone" title="A couple of other paddlers playing" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0292-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> Then you can tell that Jake wasn't too enthusiastic about his situation by his next picture. <a rel="attachment wp-att-440" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0303/"><img class="size-large wp-image-440 alignnone" title="Jake pondering his fate" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0303-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> Thomas and the rest of us swam through the hole. <a rel="attachment wp-att-441" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0305/"><img class="size-large wp-image-441 alignnone" title="Thomas swimming through a hole" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0305-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> Then I got to practice being bag bait for Jeff. <a rel="attachment wp-att-442" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0315/"><img class="size-full wp-image-442 alignnone" title="It was warmer to hop in the water and keep swimming" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0315.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="800" /></a> <p style="text-align: left;">
  Jake followed that up by taking one of the better pictures of me.

<a rel="attachment wp-att-443" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0321/"><img class="size-full wp-image-443 alignnone" title="One of the better pictures of me" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0321.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="800" /></a> But apparently Jake's own situation went downhill slightly. <a rel="attachment wp-att-444" href="http://alexkerney.com/2011/03/swiftwater/dsc_0612/"><img class="size-large wp-image-444 alignnone" title="Jake's fate continues to go downhill" src="http://alexkerney.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/DSC_0612-494x327.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="327" /></a> <p style="text-align: left;">
  And, I hopped in the water again to snag another instructor.

  All too soon it was the end of the day and at end of the weekend we found ourselves back in the parking lot where some serenading took place.
