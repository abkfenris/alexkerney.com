All my stuff is packed, except for my computer, there's apparently breakfast downstairs (but I probably can't eat any of it), and then all that's left is to head for the airport. Currently I taking LA 80 from Punta Arenas to Santiago where I transfer to LA 530 to JFK with a midnight stop in Lima and then I'm on AA 3812 from JFK to Boston tomorrow. Bonus points for any one that can identify the boat in the picture, or at least the owners. A-Basin folks rather than Mainers might have a better chance at this one though. Hint: They also row and write. Oh and good luck to Dobish, may he survive his bachelor party intact.
