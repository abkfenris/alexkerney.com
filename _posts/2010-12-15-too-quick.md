I was not expecting anyone to be getting Christmas Cards this fast, but since they are arriving I should at least post a little update. <p style="text-align: center;">

</p> I'm headed down there to hop on a 70 foot boat for 6 months to do climate change research.

  We will start by sailing out to the Falkland Islands, before visiting the Horn, and then sailing up the Patagonian Fjords.

And, at other times it will just be two of us attempting to lose thousands worth of machinery.
